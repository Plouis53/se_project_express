# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Functionality
This project serves as the back-end component of the WTWR application. It involves the development of an API with carefully configured URL routes. Additionally, a MongoDB database is created and appropriately configured to store and manage the application's data.
By building the back-end infrastructure, the project enables seamless communication between the front-end and the server, allowing for efficient data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

## Technologies and Techniques
Controllers serve as the destination for handling requests by containing a collection of request handler functions. Models are utilized to define and store schemas, which represent the structure and organization of data. Routes play a crucial role in managing the exchange of data between the user and the server, facilitating the transmission of webpages and receiving user input.
By compartmentalizing different components of the application, such as controllers, models, and routes, the codebase is structured in a modular and organized manner. This enables seamless debugging and easier maintenance. MongoDB serves as the underlying database, providing a reliable storage solution, while Express.js empowers the creation and manipulation of data, enabling smooth interactions between the server and the database.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
